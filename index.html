    <!-- Chosen Palette: Refined Slate & Sky with Energetic Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard with top navigation (`Overview`, `Diagnosis`, `Segments`, `Solutions`, `Summary`). This structure creates a narrative flow. Overview includes the problem statement and funnel chart. Diagnosis uses interactive cards. Segments use tabs. Solutions use toggles. Summary recaps the case. Professional theme with subtle gamification through engaging animations and clear interactive feedback. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. User Drop-off Funnel (Overview): Goal=Inform. Viz=Chart.js Bar Chart (styled as funnel). Interaction=None. Justification=Visualizes core problem.
        2. Problem Diagnosis Cards (Diagnosis): Goal=Organize/Relate. Method=HTML/Tailwind cards + JS toggle. Interaction=Click to reveal details. Justification=Connects reasons to data analysis. Enhanced hover/reveal animations. Professional icons.
        3. User Segments Tabs (Segments): Goal=Compare. Method=HTML/Tailwind tabs + JS content switching. Interaction=Click tab. Content fades in. Justification=Easy comparison of personas.
        4. Experiment Details (Solutions): Goal=Compare/Inform. Method=HTML/Tailwind layout + JS toggle. Interaction=Buttons to switch. Content fades in. Justification=Structured presentation of solutions.
        5. Summary Section (Summary): Goal=Summarize. Method=HTML/Tailwind text layout. Interaction=None. Justification=Provides a quick recap of the entire case study.
